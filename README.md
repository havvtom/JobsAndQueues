# Jobs and Queues Project

## Overview

The Jobs and Queues Project is a background job management system built with Laravel. It allows users to add jobs to a queue, execute them with delays, and track their status. The system supports job prioritization, retry logic, and provides an easy-to-use interface for managing jobs.

## Features

- **Job Creation**: Easily add custom jobs to the queue with class names, methods, parameters, priority, and delay.
- **Job Prioritization**: Supports job priority, with higher priority jobs being processed first.
- **Delay Support**: Schedule jobs to run at a future time by specifying a delay in seconds.
- **Retry Logic**: Automatically retry jobs up to a specified number of attempts if they fail.
- **Job Status**: Track job statuses such as `pending`, `running`, `completed`, and `failed`.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of job processing, including success and failure events.
